# Project_1
Project 1 for CS329E

The unity stuff is in the assets folder, I just couldnt for the life of me figure out how to upload my entire project file. I followed the tutorial but sadly it doesn't account for flags and it seems like it'll be a pain to implement.

the basic framework explained by the professor is also available at this link:
